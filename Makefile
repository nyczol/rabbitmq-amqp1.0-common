# Variables and recipes in development.*.mk are meant to be used from
# any Git clone. They are excluded from the files published to Hex.pm.
# Generated files are published to Hex.pm however so people using this
# source won't have to depend on Python and rabbitmq-codegen.
#
# That's why those Makefiles are included with `-include`: we ignore any
# inclusion errors.
